# GitHub Actions Best Practices Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended approach for consolidating and improving your GitHub Actions workflows based on industry best practices.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified:

- **12 different workflow files** with overlapping functionality
- **Inconsistent authentication** (mix of access keys and IAM roles)
- **Security gaps** in some workflows
- **Maintenance overhead** from managing multiple workflows
- **Confusion** about which workflow to use

### Security Concerns:

- Some workflows still use deprecated AWS access keys
- Inconsistent permission models
- Missing security scanning in some workflows

## Recommended 3-Tier Approach

### 1. **ci.yml** - Continuous Integration

**Purpose**: Run on every push and PR to validate code quality
**Features**:

- ✅ Security scanning with Trivy
- ✅ Backend tests with coverage
- ✅ Frontend tests with coverage
- ✅ Terraform plan (no apply)
- ✅ Code quality checks

**Triggers**: `push`, `pull_request` on all branches

### 2. **deploy.yml** - Standard Deployment

**Purpose**: Deploy to environments after CI passes
**Features**:

- ✅ Build and push Docker images
- ✅ Terraform apply (using plan from CI)
- ✅ ECS service updates
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ Manual trigger with environment selection
- ✅ **Sub-environment support** (dev22 → dev22.hibiji.com)

**Triggers**: `workflow_dispatch` only (manual deployment)

### 3. **emergency-deploy.yml** - Emergency Deployments

**Purpose**: Urgent deployments that bypass some checks
**Features**:

- ✅ Bypasses CI checks for speed
- ✅ Requires reason documentation
- ✅ Full deployment pipeline
- ✅ Audit trail

**Triggers**: `workflow_dispatch` only

## Security Improvements

### Authentication

- **✅ IAM Role-Based**: All workflows use `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret
- **❌ Removed**: AWS access keys from all workflows
- **✅ OIDC**: GitHub Actions OIDC for secure role assumption

### Permissions

- **Minimal permissions**: Each workflow has only necessary permissions
- **Security events**: CI workflow can write security events
- **ID token**: Deploy workflows can write ID tokens for OIDC

### Security Scanning

- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning in CI
- **SARIF**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Dependency scanning**: npm audit and pip-audit integration

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Workflows

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows/backup
cp .github/workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/backup/
```

### Step 2: Deploy New Workflows

The new workflows have been created:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/emergency-deploy.yml`

### Step 3: Configure Secrets

Ensure these secrets are set in GitHub:

```
AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/GitHubActionsRole
```

### Step 4: Test New Workflows

1. Push to a feature branch to test CI
2. Create a PR to verify CI runs
3. Test manual deployment trigger (no auto-deploy on main)
4. Test emergency deployment workflow

### Step 5: Cleanup Old Workflows

After confirming new workflows work:

```bash
# Remove old workflows (keep backups)
rm .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml
rm .github/workflows/secure-ci-cd-pipeline.yml
rm .github/workflows/deploy-with-iam-role.yml
rm .github/workflows/essential-ci.yml
rm .github/workflows/efficient-ci-cd.yml
rm .github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml
rm .github/workflows/simple-secure-deploy.yml
rm .github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml
rm .github/workflows/multi-sub-environment-deploy.yml
rm .github/workflows/deploy-only.yml
rm .github/workflows/debug-workflow.yml
```

## Workflow Comparison

| Feature                 | Old Approach         | New Approach           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Number of Workflows** | 12 files             | 3 files                |
| **Authentication**      | Mixed (keys + roles) | IAM roles only         |
| **Security Scanning**   | Inconsistent         | Always in CI           |
| **Terraform Plan**      | Mixed approaches     | Consistent plan/apply  |
| **Manual Triggers**     | Multiple workflows   | Single deploy workflow |
| **Emergency Deploy**    | None                 | Dedicated workflow     |
| **Sub-environments**    | Separate workflow    | Integrated in deploy   |
| **Maintenance**         | High overhead        | Low overhead           |

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- CI: Validation and testing only
- Deploy: Building and deployment
- Emergency: Urgent deployments

### 2. **Security First**

- IAM role-based authentication
- Minimal required permissions
- Security scanning in every CI run

### 3. **Consistency**

- Standardized environment variables
- Consistent naming conventions
- Unified error handling

### 4. **Reliability**

- Artifact sharing between workflows
- Proper dependency management
- Health checks after deployment

### 5. **Maintainability**

- Reduced workflow count
- Clear documentation
- Standardized patterns

## Environment Strategy

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code (manual deployment required)
- **staging**: Staging environment
- **dev**: Development environment
- **dev22, dev23, etc.**: Sub-development environments (dev22.hibiji.com)
- **qa01, qa02, etc.**: Sub-QA environments (qa01.hibiji.com)
- **staging01, staging02, etc.**: Sub-staging environments (staging01.hibiji.com)
- **hotfix01, hotfix02, etc.**: Hotfix environments (hotfix01.hibiji.com)
- **prod**: Production environment (hibiji.com) - deployed from main branch
- **feature branches**: CI only

### Environment Variables

```yaml
# Set per environment
TF_VAR_environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'prod' || 'dev' }}
```

### Sub-Environment Support

The new workflows support sub-environments with automatic domain mapping:

- **Branch-based**: `dev22` branch → `dev22.hibiji.com`
- **Manual deployment**: Select `dev22` → deploys to `dev22.hibiji.com`
- **Terraform integration**: Uses `sub_environment` variable
- **Health checks**: Automatically checks the correct domain

**Examples**:

- `dev22` branch → `dev22.hibiji.com`
- `qa01` branch → `qa01.hibiji.com`
- `staging03` branch → `staging03.hibiji.com`
- `hotfix01` branch → `hotfix01.hibiji.com`
- `main` branch → `hibiji.com` (production)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Metrics

- CI success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Emergency deployment frequency
- Security scan results

### Health Checks

- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity
- External service dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **IAM Role Issues**

   ```bash
   # Verify role exists
   aws iam get-role --role-name GitHubActionsRole
   ```

2. **ECR Repository Issues**

   ```bash
   # Create repositories if missing
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name dpp-backend
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name dpp-frontend
   ```

3. **Terraform State Issues**
   ```bash
   # Use the terraform-state-reset.sh script
   ./scripts/terraform-state-reset.sh
   ```

### Debug Workflow

Keep `debug-workflow.yml` for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Don't delete this file during cleanup
# Use for debugging AWS permissions and configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy new workflows and test
2. **Short-term**: Migrate to new workflows
3. **Medium-term**: Clean up old workflows
4. **Long-term**: Add advanced features (cost optimization, advanced security)
